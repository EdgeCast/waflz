## Background
An implementation of a WAF engine in c/c++ supporting processing a subset of ModSecurity rules functionalties, configurable with either json or ModSecurity rules.  waflz is optimized to support running many WAF profiles side by side, by using [faster](https://github.com/VerizonDigital/waflz/blob/master/src/op/nms.h "IP tree")/[smaller](https://github.com/VerizonDigital/waflz/blob/master/src/op/ac.h "Ahoâ€“Corasick") internal data types and sharing common ruleset data between the profiles -ie if multiple WAF profiles refer to the same ruleset(s), the ruleset(s) are loaded only once for all and shared in memory.

### Rationale
The VDMS global edge platform is a multitenant CDN supporting our hundreds of thousands individual customer configurations from any given location.  The VDMS WAF supports running OWASP Core Rulesets as well as some third-party rulesets.  The performance and resource allocation of any given customer configuration has the potential of impacting others -ie eventually all configurations live in memory on a physical server in a "Point of Presence" (POP) in a datacenter.  It was important then to the VDMS CDN the WAF be as high performant, memory constrained, and deterministic as possible.

### Capabilities
The open source standard implementation of the [ModSecurity Rules Engine](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity "ModSecurity") -while excellent, and extremely flexible for individuals' use-cases, could be problematic in a CDN, where performance is the product.  Several ModSecurity capabilities eg [SecRemoteRules](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#SecRemoteRules "SecRemoteRules") and [inspectFile](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-%28v2.x%29#inspectFile "inspectFile"), were intentionally ommitted, due to potential performance impacts in a multitenant environment.  A list of currently supported variables, operators and transforms are listed in the [capabilities section of the docs](https://verizondigital.github.io/waflz/capabilities "waflz capabilities")

## Usage

### Running standalone waflz_server for testing WAF rules

```sh
$ cat rule.conf
  SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Host "@eq 0" \
        "phase:2,\
        rev:'2',\
        ver:'OWASP_CRS/2.2.9',\
        t:none,block,\
        msg:'Request Missing a Host Header',\
        id:'960008',\
        severity:'4',\
        setvar:'tx.msg=%{rule.msg}',\
        setvar:tx.anomaly_score=+%{tx.warning_anomaly_score},\
        setvar:tx.%{rule.id}-OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/MISSING_HEADER-%{matched_var_name}=%{matched_var}"

$ ./build/util/waflz_server/waflz_server --modsecurity=rule.conf

```

### curl'ing waflz_server

```sh
$ curl -s "http://localhost:12345/index.html" -H"Host:" | jq '.'
{
  "matched_var": {
    "name": "REQUEST_HEADERS",
    "value": "MA=="

  "rule_op_name": "gt",
  "rule_op_param": "0",
  "rule_tag": [
    "OWASP_CRS/ANOMALY/EXCEEDED"
  ],

      "param": "ANOMALY_SCORE"
    }
  ],
  "sub_event": [
    {
      "matched_var": {
        "name": "REQUEST_HEADERS",
        "value": "MA=="
      },
      "rule_id": 960008,
      "rule_intercept_status": 403,
      "rule_msg": "Request Missing a Host Header",

          "name": "REQUEST_HEADERS",
          "param": "Host"
        }
      ],
      "total_anomaly_score": 3,
      "waf_profile_id": "__na__",
      "waf_profile_name": "__na__"
    }
  ],
